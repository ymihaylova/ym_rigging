Questions and notes for Weds:

If the ankle joint retains a ~180 orientation due to it being world oriented, this appears to cause flipping when switching between IK and FK in a parent constraint situation. Why would that be? The ik joint and blend joint are orientated exactly the same, and so are the FK ctls/offsets/groups.
